We have a huge advertising campaign that all departments are preparing for,
so the company informed me about some requirements to help them in their campaign,
as The Campaign Manager want to track of the behavior of each customer in each country and
all the transactions they made,Customer Satisfaction Manager wants to add a notice
to the campaign about organizing a contest to reward the most buying customers 
and motivate the less buying ones,The marketing manager wants to know the best-selling
and least-selling products in each country to study organizing a huge advertising campaign 
covering the problems facing the least-selling products in the markets in each country, 
The Campaign manager wants to keep track of the relations between all countries in terms of sales order,
The Customer Service Manager wants to get information when the last time the customer made a purchase,
and when was the time before it, how much time is between the two periods,
and the total number of times this customer made a purchase in general
